    in Kotlin, if you want to write a function or any
    member of the class that can be called without having
    the instance of the class then you can write the same as
    a member of a companion object inside the class. So,
    by declaring the companion object,
    you can access the members of the class by class
     name only(which is without explicitly creating the
      instance of the class).
